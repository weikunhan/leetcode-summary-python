# Last-In-First-Out

The following questions, I prefer to solve by using LIFO. It may have the optimal method, please check the discussion in LeetCode.  

* [Stack](##Stack)

## Stack

In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed. The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (last in, first out). Additionally, a peek operation may give access to the top without modifying the stack. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type))

This type of problem includes: maintain LIFO cache problem

The time complexity of the stack is Push-Top O(1) and Pop-Top O(1). The Space complexity of the stack is O(n).
