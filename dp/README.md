# Dynamic Programming

The following questions, I prefer to solve by using DP. It may have the optimal method, please check the discussion in LeetCode. When you try to come up a DP solution, you need to know 4 things: 1)state, 2)function, 3)initialization, 4)answer

* [Coordinate DP](##Coordinate-DP) 
* [Sequential DP](##Sequential-DP)
* [Bidirectional Sequence DP](##Bidirectional-Sequence-DP)
* [Interval DP](##Interval-DP)
* [Divided DP](##Divided-DP)
* [Knapsack DP](##Knapsack-DP)
* [Comprehensive DP](##Comprehensive-DP)
* [Game type DP](##Game-type-DP)
