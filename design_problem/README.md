# Design Problem

For prepare the design problem, there are three kinds of design problems:

* System design (Scenario, Service, Storage, Scale)
* API design 
* OOA, OOD, OOP (Clarify, Core objects, Cases, Classes, Correctness)

Also, there are algorithms that you should know before system design. The related resources should:

* Bloom filter
* Frugal streaming
* Geohash&S2 Geometry
* Leaky bucket&Token bucket algorithm
* Loosy Counting
* Operational transformation algorithm
* Quadtree&Rtree algorithm
* Ray casting algorithm
* Reverse index algorithm
* Rsync algorithm
* Trie algorithm
* Consistent hashing

For more informaiton, you need to check related courses and books. Here, I split the system design problem from LeetCode into following topic.

* [Prefix Tree](##Prefix-Tree)
* [Hash Map&Set](##Hash-Map&Set)
* [First-In-First-Out](##First-In-First-Out)
* [First-In-Last-Out](##First-In-Last-Out)
* [Depth-First search](##Depth-First-search)
* [Heap Sort](#Heap-Sort)
* [Binary Seasrch](##Binary-Seasrch)
* [Others](##Others)
