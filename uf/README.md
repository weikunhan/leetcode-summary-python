# Union-Find

The following questions, I prefer to solve by using Union-Find. It may have the optimal method, please check the discussion in LeetCode.  

* [Graph](##Graph)
* [2D Array](##2D-Array)

## Graph

In computer science, a disjoint-set data structure, also called a union–find data structure or merge–find set, is a data structure that stores a collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets. Equivalently, it stores a partition of a set into disjoint subsets. It provides operations for adding new sets, merging sets (replacing them by their union), and finding a representative member of a set. The last operation allows to find out efficiently if any two elements are in the same or different sets. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure)

This type of problem includes: find connections problem, find minimum cost problem

The time complexity of the union-find is (log*(n)).

## 2D Array

By using a hash table, some 2D array question can use union-find to solve.

This type of problem includes: find share points problem

The time complexity of the union-find is (log*(n)).
